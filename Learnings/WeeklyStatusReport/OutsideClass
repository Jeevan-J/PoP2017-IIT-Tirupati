What you learnt outside the class?
Week 1
I read an article called Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems by Judea Pearl.
In that I encountered terms like Bayesian networks and Casuality , I read about them in wiki.
Lot of them didn't make any sense but what I understood is they have a plenty of applications in the near future in AI and Machine learning
I would like to study about them a little bit more.
